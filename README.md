## 🔍 Investigation Methodology

### Step 1: Initial Visual Analysis
The investigation began with careful visual observation of the image.

The following elements were identified:
- Presence of **iconic and large buildings**, indicating a **big or well-developed city**
- A **garden-like area** was visible near the location where the person was standing
- A **lake or water body** was observed in the right corner when zooming into the image
- The person appeared to be standing at a **height**, likely on a building
- The building featured a **balcony with a rounded railing**, suggesting a **circular or semi-circular structure**

These observations helped form an initial understanding of the environment.

### Step 2: Reverse Image Search & Landmark Identification

To gain additional context, a **reverse image search** was performed using **Yandex Image Search**.

The image background was uploaded to Yandex, which returned multiple visually similar results containing **iconic buildings and skyline views**. Many of these results were associated with the **London Skyline**, indicating that the image was likely taken in **London**.

#### Iconic Building Analysis
Among the returned results, one **distinctive and iconic building** stood out repeatedly. This building had a **unique curved and cylindrical shape**, which made it easily recognizable.

Further independent research on this building revealed that it is:

**30 St Mary Axe (The Gherkin)**  
- A **591 ft (180 m)** tall skyscraper  
- Located in the **City of London**  
- Known for its **distinctive modern architecture**

Identifying this landmark confirmed that the image background belonged to the **London metropolitan area**, further strengthening the accuracy of the investigation.

This information significantly narrowed the search area and allowed the investigation to proceed with **Google Earth** for precise geolocation.

### Step 3: Google Earth Geolocation Using Landmark Address

After identifying the iconic building as **30 St Mary Axe (The Gherkin)**, the **exact address** of the building was used to continue the investigation.

The location **30 St Mary Axe, City of London** was searched directly in **Google Earth**, which provided a precise satellite view of the landmark and its surrounding area.

### Area-Based Analysis
Using the confirmed location as a reference point, further analysis was performed by:
- Examining nearby buildings visible in the original image
- Observing surrounding **roads, open spaces, and urban layout**
- Analyzing nearby **green areas and water bodies** visible from satellite imagery
- Comparing building shapes and relative positioning

This landmark-based approach allowed the investigation to move from **general city identification** to **precise geolocation analysis**.

The information obtained from this step formed the foundation for deeper comparison and confirmation in subsequent analysis.
