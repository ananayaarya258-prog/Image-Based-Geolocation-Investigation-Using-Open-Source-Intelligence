🔍 Investigation Methodology
Step 1: Initial Visual Observation

The first step was to carefully visualize and observe all visible elements in the image without making assumptions.

The following observations were made:

Presence of iconic, large buildings, indicating a big or well-developed city

The environment appeared urban but open, not extremely crowded

A garden-like area was visible near the location where the person was standing

A lake or water body was observed in the right corner when zooming into the image

A person was standing at a height, likely on a building

The building had a balcony with a rounded railing, suggesting a circular or semi-circular structure

These visual details helped form an initial idea of the location type.
